First Webpage With Odin

This will be my first project in building a website in HTML
Man what a journey so far.
I can
-Create a html boilerplate
-Title my webpage
-Write in paragraphs and headers 1-6
-Can commit my coding so it is saved as I create with git
-Can link to other sites and mine using absolute and relative links
-Add images to my sites with <img src="image.png" alt="image" width, height>
-Can make lists with <ul> and <ol>
-Can make text bold and italic with <strong> and <em>
